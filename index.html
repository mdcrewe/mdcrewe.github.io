        Crewe Family Christmas Annual Guess the BS
    </h1>

        What is guess the BS???
    </h2>

    <p class="center">
        Guess the BS (or guess the blood sugar) is an annual Christmas tradition        <br>
        where our extended family all guess what my Grandfather, Donald Crewe's blood   <br>
        sugar reading will be on boxing day morning (after spending all Christmas       <br>
        day eating to his heart's content). Donald, you see, is diabetic, so this       <br>
        reading can widely vary and has over the years, and no matter how much logic    <br>
        or medical training is used, no one really has an advantage, not even Donald,   <br>
        who has yet to win in the 8 iterations of the tradition!
