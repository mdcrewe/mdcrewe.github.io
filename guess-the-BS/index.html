        What is guess the BS???
    </h2>

    <p class="center">
        Guess the BS (or guess the blood sugar) is an annual Christmas tradition        <br>
        where our extended family all guess what my Grandfather, Donald Crewe's blood   <br>
        sugar reading will be on Boxing Day morning (after spending all Christmas       <br>
        day eating to his heart's content). Donald, you see, is diabetic, so this       <br>
        reading can widely vary and has over the years, and no matter how much logic    <br>
        or medical training is used, no one really has an advantage, not even Donald,   <br>
        who has yet to win in the 9 iterations of the tradition!
    </p>

    <h2 class="center">
        What are the rules?
    </h2>

    <p class="center">
        To keep it simple, we play by The Price Is Right Rules! That simply means that <br>
        in order to win, you have to be equal to or below the final reading. If you're <br>
        0.1 above the actual reading, too bad! This does result in some strategy about <br>
        guessing after you know other people's guesses, but it is up to the participant<br>
        to determine how slimy they're willing to be! Because of this rule, we've also <br>
        had years where no one has won because everyone has guessed above the final    <br> 
        reading, which might make guessing low worth the thought!
